            My work at Retail Brands - Hotel Chocolat & Swarovski in the Nordic
          </h2>
          <p>
            Working at Retail Brands taught me how to work with important
            inter&shy;national brands. Retail Brands was a Danish retail company
            that covered <span>Hotel Chocolat and Swarovski</span> in the Nordic
            market. I was a student worker who was responsible for
            administrating and man&shy;aging their e-Commerce store and
            creat&shy;ing content through graphical programs for their
            marketing. The website was based on Dynamic&shy;web, a no-code
            plat&shy;form that comb&shy;ined
            <span> CMS, PIM, e-Commerce, and market&shy;ing.</span>
            <br />
            I honed my skills in graphical work while work&shy;ing in the
            marketing depart&shy;ment, where I had to create pictures for the
            website as well as social media posts. Underneath are some examples
            of my work.

          <h2>My own website</h2>
          <p>
            Working at Retail Brands showed me that there were limits to how one
            can work with site builders based on no-coding. I researched
            different site builders to figure out the limitations and strengths
            of them in order to find where I can realise the ideas that I have.
            I started researching more about
            <span>coding websites</span> and became interested in the
            possibilities that open up and how much there is to learn. Learning
            HTML and CSS would give me the tools to design webpages just how I
            imagine them to be. I ha&shy;ve since then taught myself how to code
            with <span>HTML and CSS.</span> I can proud&shy;ly say that this
            website is built from scratch by myself.<br />
            <br />
